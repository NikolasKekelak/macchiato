# macchiato
This tool finds most optimal automat sequence, put it into Karnaugh maps and find Boolean expressions for these maps using another program ESPRESSO.

How to use?

At start you choose either you want Moore (0) type or Mealy type (1). 

Next you write your sequence ( for example: 1000011, 0100100 .... ). Sequence does not currently have limitiation for sequence length. Afterward you have multiple "yes" or "no" questions:

Karnaugh maps.
Espresso input fil.
Turn karnaugh maps into booelean expressions (using EXPRESSO)
